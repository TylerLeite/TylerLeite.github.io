<!--
This is the source code, it's not too special. If you came here wondering why I
end my stories with a ìèà character, you're in luck.

It's the unicode character for the Egyptian hieroglyph for a milk jug (W20 jrtjt).
You may have noticed that the favicon for my website is also a milk jug, albeit a
more modern one. Basically what it comes down to is that my last name, Leite, is
Portuguese for milk.

If your browser can't render a ìèà, get a better one. Or a better computer. Or
update your fonts. Or just deal with it. I think those are the only options.

          I always really loved writing. Mostly creative fiction, but essays are always pretty relaxing to set down and write. I haven't written since high school, since I figured I didn't have the time. Well I'm gonna make the time. On August 15, 2017, I decided to start writing again. One short story a day, spending about an hour on it. Not worrying about polish or anything, no editing or proofreading. Just pure stream-of-conscious to get back in the habit. I don't know how long I'll keep this up, but I'm committed to 100 days in a row. If I miss one, the count resets. Should be fun!

          ‚ÄúYeah, see that? 100% pure quality Japanese workmanship! Ain‚Äôt it the most beautiful thing you‚Äôve ever seen. See how the sun bounces off the steel juuust right? Beautiful. This baby set me back a good hundred-thousand yen - that‚Äôs like nearly 5 grand, boys. And you know what? It‚Äôs worthy every penny. This baby, she‚Äôll never dull. Never crack, never rust, never nothin. Good as the day I got it 10 years ago, and it‚Äôll outlast me by a long shot. Yeah, you could say I love this little blade. More than I love any person, that‚Äôs for sure. Heh, maybe I‚Äôm crazy. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù
        </p>

        <p>
          There was no one else in the room. Never had been. There was also no knife. Never had been one of those either. Yeah, that man was certified nuts. But he enjoyed his life, at least. Some might say it‚Äôs sad, getting so much joy out of impressing a completely fabricated audience. Earning the respect and admiration of the imaginary and just loving it. Soaking in the love. Taking pride in fake possessions, not always a Japanese knife. Sometimes Mexican jewelry, or French designer clothes. Always something exotic, but something that made sense to him. Something he knew was believable. That‚Äôs the only way he could believe it, at least.
        </p>

        <p>
          ‚ÄúYou know this isn‚Äôt even my first one like it. Not that the other one broke, obviously. These things could cut through a mountain and not get a scratch on them. No, it was stolen from me. And worse still, it wasn‚Äôt just some trinket I‚Äôd bought myself, no offense, but it was something given to me by my grandfather. You see, my grandfather was a great man. Well, some called him great. Others terrible, others evil. He was a crime boss. That knife, he used it to inspire his men, and instill fear in his enemies. My father died in the drug war, otherwise he would have got that knife. But he died a man, and that‚Äôs all one can ask. Nothing else really matters in the end‚Äù
        </p>

        <p>
          The man‚Äôs audience oohed and aahed. If anyone else could see, they would be incredulous to say the least. The crowd, so real to that man, were truly poor facsimiles of real people. Their reactions so fake, their gestures exaggerated. Almost like this man had never truly captivated anyone in his life, and he was going off his intuition, and what he‚Äôd seen in movies.
        </p>

        <p>
          ‚ÄúAnd when I woke up, it was gone. All I had to show for it was a scar on my hand where I was holding it tight. As much as I love this baby, it‚Äôs no real replacement. One day, I‚Äôm gonna track down that thug with my knife, and I‚Äôm gonna take it right back. Don‚Äôt believe me? I already know where he is. I mean no offense guys, but why else would I be in this dump of a town.‚Äù. The man smirked. It was almost time.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don‚Äôt want to explain the sad scene that followed the man‚Äôs speech. It‚Äôs too sad to go into the delusions that led a man to construct a crowd of admirers, let alone the paranoia that led him to distrust them, for no reason, such that his mind had to construct a new narrative. One that gave him a position of power despite his fear. Or more accurately, one that let him feel power to dismiss his fear. I don‚Äôt want to explain his shadow fight with imaginary men, brandishing his knife, impressing himself with his skill, fighting through the pain of a dozen battle wounds. I don‚Äôt want to think about how proud he was for holding his own against a dozen invisible thugs all by himself. And it‚Äôs not because that thought alone is so sad. It‚Äôs because he lost.

          "It was a bright and sunny day. And then... disaster struck. Oh man, was it bad. People were all like "Oh man, maybe if it was like dark and stormy out or something, we'd at least be like prepared. But like, this is totally unexpected!" And they were all screaming and yelling and no one knew what was going on. But then, out of the blue there was this dude that came outta the sky. Like he was flying and all that. And he shouted out "Hey, uh, guys! I'm the- I'm the guy who's gonna... who's, I'm gonna save you all!" And people were all like "Wow how's this  guy supposed to save us from a tornado" Oh yeah, it was a tornado, that was the disaster that struck. But anyway the guy, you know the one from the sky who's like flying all around, he just starts flying in the opposite direction of the tornado! But not like.. He doesn't run away from the tornado, he's right next to it but like the tornado is spinning clockwise and he's flying counterclockwise. Or something. Anyway, he saves the day and everyone is happy. The end."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What the heck was that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnny broke into laughter
        </p>
        <p>
          "No really, that's gotta be like, the worst story anyone's ever heard in their life. Ugh, I'm going to bed"
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnny lay back down. It wasn't really his fault. After a few weeks, he ran out of stories he'd read. At this point he was just having to make things up off the top of his head. At first he'd try to think of them throughout the day, gather his thoughts. Then come bedtime, he'd have something at least passable. Sarah wasn't exactly a tough crowd to please. What little kid was? But these days, he had to work longer and harder just to keep them fed. Johnny felt tears welling up. It was hard. He wasn't ready to be taking care of himself, let alone another person. All he cared about was keeping his sister happy, driving away all the bad feelings she was probably working hard to keep down herself. He shifted his weight. Johnny liked to sleep on his face. He'd grown used to his side though. So he could watch his sister. Make sure she was safe, that she didn't fall out of her hammock. That no wild animals came by looking for a free snack. He pushed those thoughts down. She was safe. They were both safe. There were no predators on this island, he'd explored nearly the whole thing. Plus there's not enough prey for them to live off of. He was hardly comforted by that, though. For all he knew, there were jungle cats prowling around, and they were just hiding in the daytime, out of sight. He pushed those thoughts down too. He lay there, awake, watching over Sarah for nearly an hour. But he knew, he had to get some sleep. Tomorrow was another big day. Every day was another big day. He wasn't getting enough food, if he didn't get enough sleep either... He didn't even really care about his own health though, except because he needed it to protect his sister. Johnny closed his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Morning came. Johnny was up first, as always. Another rough night, he was barely rested at all. But he had chores to do. He woke up Sarah, told her he was going to check the traps. She sighed, and nodded, and went back to sleep. Despite himself, Johnny enjoyed the mornings. Paranoia aside, it was nice to be alone for a little while. He went down to the bay and checked his nets. No fish. He knew he was doing something wrong, they hadn't caught a single fish in weeks. But no one ever taught him what to do. He never thought one day his life, and the life of his sister, would depend on him being a hunter. He sat down on a jetty-like boulder about 10 feet from shore. Watching the sunrise over the horizon, his feet in the water. It made him homesick. He set his net again, and came back ashore, to check his other traps. He made his rounds. All his traps were primitive, and fairly ineffective. Holes in the ground with stakes at the bottom, leaves to cover them up. He was honestly surprised every time one of them worked. Today he caught a hare. The biggest yet. He also found a bird's nest. He knew his sister would never eat a fetal bird, and she'd be pretty mad at him for eating it too. But he was starving. He took the eggs and hid them in his shirt. He'd have them for breakfast tomorrow. He cleaned and gutted the hare in the woods. Chopped it up, too. It's the only way his sister would eat it, if it looked like something from a grocery store, and not a bunny.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time he had got back to camp, Sarah had started a fire. She was pretty good at it. Mom always called her a pyro, only half jokingly. Of course dad was proud, he's the one who taught her. Johnny couldn't start one to save his life. He knew that from experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's for breakfast, John" "Chicken" "Again?" "Well, there's not much else on this island. Some berries and nuts, maybe, but I never learned what's poison and what's safe." "No fish again?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnny skewered the meat, handed his sister a few pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No fish. They must be pretty smart" "Smarter than you-", she smiled "-but that doesn't mean pretty smart". Johnny cracked a smile as well. They ate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Johnny had decided that if they were going to keep surviving, he'd have to start growing a garden. Only problem was, he really didn't know what was poison and what was safe. He found some yams one day, figured they were probably good to eat. He cooked some up one day, in secret. Tested them out on himself. That was last week and he was feeling fine. That meant today was the day. He told his sister he was going out foraging. She told him she was going to play in the water. He had a little bag he'd made out of one of his shirts. It was going to be useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The island was surprisingly large. Well, it was still small for an island, but it took a good two hours to get from one side to the other. Johnny wasn't good at much, but he could find his way around the island with ease. Somehow, he noticed all the little landmarks in that impossibly similar forest. Each tree, to him, was like an old friend. And they told him the way to wherever he needed to be. After about an hour, he found the patch of yams. Some animal had got to them, but not all of them. He picked about a half dozen, and started looking around for more. Out of the corner of his eye he saw a little bush. An all-too familiar bush. He had known it was somewhere around here. Not that close though. Johnny stood in place for a long time. Should he visit them? Would it be too hard? Eventually, he decided it was the right thing to do. To let them know everything was fine, so they could stop worrying.
        </p>
        <p>
          With each step closer, he could feel his heart pounding louder, and louder. He felt the blood rushing throughout his body, from his chest to his neck, up into his ears. Then back down to his gut, through his legs, and feet. His head was throbbing, his knees felt like they might give out at any time. The smell hit him long before they were in sight. He expected it, the climate was hot and wet. He could do the math. That didn't make it any less horrible. He couldn't stop now though. At a certain point, he was no longer in control of his own body. And then he saw them. But not as they were before. Mom was still holding dad's arm tight, but they had been dragged. Dad's arm, his arm he held Sarah with in his last minutes, was gone. Little scraps of Johnny's parents had left a skidmark tracing back to the plane. It was enough to make him nearly faint. Tears clouded his vision, but he saw a shadow move. And soon, it was no longer a shadow. It was a killing machine. Its muscles writhed under its skin. It licked its chops as it stared Johnny down. They looked into each other's eyes. Johnny couldn't move. The creature let out an awful roar. If Johnny had any control over his body, he would have dropped his yams and ran. But he was petrified.
        </p>
        <p>
          They stood there, staring each other down for what seemed like an eternity. Suddenly, the creature leapt at the boy. Johnny doesn't know what happened. In that moment that last thing on his mind was making memories. But when he came to, the creature was gone, his hand was bloodied, and his parents were still there. Johnny approached them. He stood silent for a little while, he didn't know what to say. But once he started, the words flowed from his mind, almost without the aid of his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry, I couldn't keep you guys safer. I know you don't want me worrying about that kind of thing but... It's hard. Taking care of Sarah by myself. She's doing great by the way, we both are." Somehow, a grin found its way onto Johnny's face "She's actually been a big help. You know sometimes I wonder who's taking care of who. She starts the fires. Dad, you'd be proud. And I think you would too, mom. I know I am." He paused. "I just wanted you guys to know that we're doing great. Look, here. See these? I'm gonna start a garden with these. Just like you used to have, mom. We're growing yams. At least I think they're yams. They sure taste like them. I hope you're not too mad at me, trying them out on myself. But I was just thinking... There's no way we can survive without them anyway. So if they're poison then I guess, you know. We're kinda screwed either way. I've been hunting, too. All I've caught so far are squirrels and a few hares. I'm not very good, but I'm getting better." Another pause, this one longer "I tell Sarah it's chicken. Maybe that's wrong, but I don't want to risk her not eating. You know how picky she can get. Boy is she stubborn when it comes to that stuff. I'd like to think she understands what kinda situation we're in. That it's life or death. But she's just so young." Johnny needed a deep breath. He took one. "She doesn't know about you guys. She thinks you landed on some different island. And one day you're gonna build a boat and come find us. I wish I could believe that too. I have dreams about it. That you guys are all right. That you really did wind up somewhere else, and all you're thinking about is being with us again. Your little knight and princess... I'll tell her, one day. If we make it home, I'm gonna have to. Maybe she'll never forgive me, but. I... I can't even handle knowing. I hate to think what it would do to her. To find out... I know I'm doing a lot of things you guys would do different. But please just believe me. I'm trying my hardest to make you guys proud."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was nearly sundown when Johnny got back. He and Sarah spend the next hour building the garden. They found a nice clearing not too far from where they slept. Weeded it, build a little moat to water the plants with. They chopped up the yams into bits, except for two of them, and planted the little chunks. Those other two were going to be dinner. Soon enough, bedtime came. Sarah was going to need a story.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful Princess. Her father was the King of all the land and her mother was the Queen of beauty. The King and Queen loved each other very much, but that was nothing compared to how much they loved the Princess. She was their little girl, and more important to them than anything else. Each night, the King and Queen would have their bravest, strongest Knight come to the castle, up all the stairs to the top of the tallest tower. That's where the Princess was. And they had the Knight tell her about all of his adventures. The time he slew the evil witch, the time he fought off an entire army all by himself, the time he won a horse riding competition against a band of centaurs... And each night the Princess listened, in perfect silence. In awe. And then she fell asleep. But one day, they King and Queen didn't send the Knight. When the Princess asked why this was, the Queen held her hand and told her the Knight was out on an adventure. She told her there was an great dragon that was terrorizing the town, and it was the Knight's job to stop it. Well the Knight was very strong, and he was very brave. But he was no match for this dragon. The dragon didn't eat the Knight. No, it wasn't interested. Instead, it grabbed the Knight in its claws and flew straight to the castle. The dragon let out a terrible scream as it knocked the tower down. The princess was lying in bed, the King and Queen there with her. The Queen was holding tightly onto the King's arm. And the King was holding tightly onto the Princess. But the dragon didn't care about any of that. He grabbed the whole lot up together, and started to fly them back to the cave. The Knight had to act quick. He sliced the dragon's feet with his sword, and made it drop them. They landed in the water. You'd think with all that armor on, the Knight would just sink. But he found the strength to carry the Princess back to shore. The King and Queen were nowhere in sight. When the Princess woke up, she asked where they were. "I'm not sure", said the Knight. But he was sure. He just couldn't make himself tell the Princess "Perhaps, they ended up just like us. And one day they'll find us, or we'll find them" The Princess didn't really believe the Knight, but she wanted to. She really did. And the Knight, he felt bad about lying to the Princess. But he would make it up to her. He'd take care of her. And he did. And after a few weeks, a fishing boat came to the island. The Princess and Knight were so happy to finally be saved. They made it back to the castle. And it was hard, but they tried their best to live happily ever after. The end."

          It's been staying dark a lot later. Days seem fuzzy, like they almost never happen. Maybe in the moment they're clear. Maybe those hours are spent in crazed confusion. What's so special about today? What makes it clear while the past weeks, months, years exist in solely in a haze? Moments of clarity, that's the real torture. Realizing your own mind is against you. Looking back, horrifying yourself. Like waking up from a nightmare, in a cold sweat, and seconds later it starts all over. The fear, panic, paranoia. You can't trust your senses, you can't even trust your thoughts. It's better, maybe, to forget all that. No, to never have made the memories. But in the moment, you're not thinking about that. There's no way you could be. If you thought you were dying. If you were sure, more than anything, that today was your last. That every detail of your surroundings seems so familiar, like you've experienced it a thousand times. At first you try to keep the thoughts out. They're too dark. Too scary. Too sad. But they creep in, they always do. Soon enough you're sure. This is what death is. Just repeating your last moments. Endlessly, in a loop. There's no other way it'd all be so familiar. How many times have you felt this sinking feeling, and never remembered. How many times have you died?
        </p>

        <p>
          At a certain point, you can't fight it. Your body moves on its own. You scream, on the inside. You bring yourself to tears. But you can't stop. Walking forward, playing the part. Repeating your steps, well-worn at this point. Walking solemnly the the next scene. You can't fight it, it's already happened. And now you have to do it over, and over. Endlessly, you're trapped. What did I do? What's so special about tonight? You always like to think you'll die old and happy, or if you're young at least you would see it coming. You'd know you were in danger, it wouldn't come out of the blue. But tonight. It's all so normal. Make a sandwich, eat it. Take a piss. Flush. So ordinary, what could have happened? What did I do to myself.
        </p>

        <p>
          And then it hits you. I really am crazy. I kill myself tonight. I drive myself to it, so caught up in the moment. I know I die, but how? I can't stand to watch. It's too much. Every second that passes builds the anticipation. It has to happen soon. A minute passes. But how soon? An hour passes. What could happen? What's going to happen to me? What did I do to myself. And then it hits you. You really are crazy. You kill yourself tonight. No I'd never do that. I love my life, it can't be that. And then you go back to the start of the night. Performing your steps, unable to stop yourself. Because it already happened. Your body moves on its own. You scream, on the inside. You bring yourself to tears. But you can't stop. Walking forward, playing the part. And then it hits you. I really am crazy. I kill myself tonight.
        </p>

        <p>
          And that sure doesn't help, saying it to yourself. Out loud. I kill myself tonight. Can you imagine, wanting nothing more than to live, but being convinced that tonight, you die. And you could have stopped it, at any time. But you didn't. It already happened. All you can do now is watch. Everything you do, feels so right. You'd almost be proud, you're repeating yourself perfectly. But how could you be. You're scared. So scared. Trembling, physically. How would you even do it? There's a knife in the kitchen, razors in the bathroom. Bags, windows. Maybe I jump, maybe I just wanted to fly. I wanted to feel the wind on my face, experience the beauty of being on top of the world. I thought I'd be fine. Invincible. I thought I'd soar, somehow. Impossibly. I just wanted to fly. I wanted to feel the wind on my face. To be like a bird, experience the beauty of being on top of the world. I thought I'd sore, somehow. Impossibly. I jump. I just want to fly. I really am crazy, after all.

          It's been staying dark a lot later. Days seem fuzzy, like they almost never happen. Maybe in the moment they're clear. Maybe those hours are spent in crazed confusion. What's so special about today?

          "I mean, maybe it's just me, you know? Maybe like, I'm the one with the problem. But I don't think so. Shit no one thinks so, I guess, but it's just so obvious to me, you know? I mean... I don't know. To me it's just like, if you're not happy then just explain that to me. I mean, Jesus. What's so hard about that? Like obviously you're fine with opening your mouth to fuckin scream in my face, so how about you just... I don't know, man... Because-"

          He's still going on. And he has been for... oh god, only 10 minutes. This is gonna be a long drive. Don't these people work for tips? How the hell does he stay in business like this. Who in their right mind would show appreciation for hearing some zit-faced, smelly, no-neck loser vent about his shitty relationship. Maybe he's relying on me to pay him off just to shut his damn mouth.
        </p>

        <p>
          "... and then it's another week, then another and another. Pretty soon I'm sure it's been a fuckin month since she even looked at me. Meanwhile, I'm just lyin there like holy shit, man. This has been the most relaxing couple weeks of my life. Fuck man, I don't need this. I don't know what the hell I did to piss off god so bad, but Jesus has he got it in for me. I can't remember the last time anything went my way, man. I mean anything. Just this morning I found out my fuckin gas meter is broken. Said I was half full and all the sudden my damn car just up and dies on me. And I got a passenger who starts flippin out. Like he's never been in a fuckin' car that ran out of gas before. Please. You ever stop and think how I feel man? Damn right I feel shitty, I don't wanna be runnin outta gas on a fuckin' freeway with some lunatic passenger breathin down my neck. You gotta make it that much worse? Is that just your sick idea of fun? Holy shit, man. I tell ya-"
        </p>

        <p>
          I won't give him the satisfaction though. My morals are actually pretty strong. I'm not about to feed into this psycho's disgusting business model. You want to torture some poor guy who just wants to get from point-a to point-b? Is that really much more effective than like, I don't know, not being a total dick? He'd probably get more tips if he just kept his damn mouth shut. Ugh. I wonder if It would kill me to jump out of this moving car. I wonder if it would still be worth it if it would. This is torture. This is worse than torture. Maybe this guy could quit the cab business and find some government work. Special ops, just stick him in a room with some foreign spy and they'll give up any secret you want. That'd be nice. No poor civilian would have to put up with his shit ever again. No wonder his girlfriend hates his guts. I've known him for all of 20 minutes and this ride would have been enough to undo years of good memories. God what would a good memory of this guy even be like? Him shutting his damn mouth for a minute?</p>
        </p>

        <p>
          "... Yeah man, it's been rough. And I got bills, man, so many fuckin bills. You know cab drivin doesn't actually put that much bread on the table. Shit I gotta just fuckin rely on the grace of strangers. Some days I get no fuckin tips man, not a penny."
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh god...
        </p>

        <p>
          "And how am I supposed to live off that, man? You know I gotta pay for my own gas? Can you believe that shit? My fuckin job is to drive around all day for pennies while my scumbag boss laughs his ass off to the bank. Meanwhile half of everything I earn is going to just being able to keep up this shitty job. Fuck man. And my mom, bless her soul. Man she can't even see anymore. Cataracts."

        <p>
          Oh sweet Jesus...

          "She can't afford to get em fixed, God knows I can't afford it. So I gotta take care of her, and I mean. I love my mother, don't you fuckin think for a second I don't. But it's hard man, it's real hard. It's like I'm either fuckin. Pissed at my girlfriend, worried sick about takin care of mom, or tryin to deal with the fact that one day, this shitty job is just not gonna fuckin cut it anymore. I mean can you imagine what's going through my head? What happens if there's a fuckin emergency, like if mom falls down the fuckin stairs. What the hell am I gonna do? I can barely afford food, man. Am I gonna have to choose between eating and, you know, keeping my own mother, my own fuckin mother who gave up everything for me. Fuckin fat lotta good that did, by the way. All the shit she went through to try and keep me happy and I end up a fuckin mess. And I can't even take care of her in her last fuckin years, man."
        </p>

        <p>
          Is he crying? Holy shit what is wrong with this guy. Why the hell does he think I give a damn about his sob story. We get it, you fucked everything up, didn't think about the consequences. Oh no, now everything is shitty? Caught you off-guard? Deal with it. You think it's my problem now? I gotta give you some charity to make up for a whole wasted life? Fat chance, guy. You're the one who fucked everything up, now you either unfuck it or shut up and take the beating.
        </p>

        <p>
          "... I just. Look man I know I've been talkin your ear off. That's not really fair"
        </p>

        <p>
          Mhm.
        </p>

        <p>
          "But it's just. Sometimes I feel like there's no one left in my life who I can really talk to, you know. Like... "
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh god, is he going to start crying?
        </p>

        <p>
          "Like my girlfriend, you know, she's so distant. And I know that's my fault but... I just.. I guess sometimes I really need to believe it's not. Like I've fucked up everything else and... maybe this is the last straw, you know? Like I just can't bring myself to believe that I'm that big a loser. And my mom. I can't bring this shit up with her. You know how bad she'd worry? Shit I might just give her a heart attack if I dumped all this on her."
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hey could you do me a favor and shut up for the rest of the ride?"
        </p>

        <p>
          And he did.

          Even he doesn't know why he keeps staring out over the sea, it only hurts him. He'd never let it show, though. He puts on a good show for his men. The rocking of the ship rolls pens on his desk. It sets a dull metronome. He likes it. Quiet ticking sets a fragile backdrop. It suits his fancy. You would never think the captain a soft man, not unless you knew him. Not unless you could look in his eyes and truly see him. But there was no one around to see his face. Dirty, shaggy, wrinkled. In some ways, it's exactly as you'd expect. He was sea-worn, heavily weathered, grimy. That's how his men would pin him, at least. In need of repair. Maybe that's better. More right, at least. If you knew to look, you'd see the streak. A slightly muddled blemish on his mask. Exactly one, from his right eye to the corner of his mouth. Maybe tonight it would grow. Each day it could. The ship rocked rather violently. Maybe something spilled in the kitchen. Captain thought he could hear the cook shouting something nasty. Nasty by any standards. Any other time, that might bring a smile to Captain's face. He wasn't in the mood though, and thought he might never be. For now it was just him and the sea. Him and the horizon. And her.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's a struggle to knock. She knows what's going on in there, and the last thing she'd want to do is make him scurry to hide his emotions. This is important though. Not for the crew, not for her, no. For him. Before she musters her courage, the door is opened. Captain looks her in the eye, and she looks back. His white hair, so clean and cared for. Most people would think it odd, such a weathered old sea-dog with hair that flows like a cotton sheet. Even more curious was its contrast with his beard. All gray and matted, more knotty than you'd think a lifetime of neglect could result in. More dirty than you'd think possible for a man who spends so much time away from dirt. It was strange, you could see the sharp outline of his jaw even through his thick coat, even through his years of age and stress. He was a beautiful man once. Some might say he still is, but in a different way. A deep man, with many lifetimes lived. His eyes did no work to betray his structure. Dark and violent as the storms that make him feel at home on the sea. Only a handful of people could see through it, perceive the man behind those eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          His streak grew last tonight, he really did need this. She stepped forward, her face in his, almost touching. He could feel her trembling. Fear? In part at least. She was certainly nervous. He was too, but to be sure he would never show it. His eyes went straight to her hands. They were clasped around a roll of paper. Old and moth-bitten. Indistinct from any other forgotten clipping. But he was expecting this, had been for years. He knew exactly what was about to happen. It almost made him shudder. Perhaps if the door were still closed, he would have.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's not too late." He could hear the telltale vibrato of her stutter. This was bad, she never got this nervous. "You and I can burn this, right here. Right now. It'll all be over. We can just forget about all this. Who's going to find us out here?" He smiled. They both knew her words were empty. It was sweet of her to try, though.
        </p>

        <p>
          "One day, Mal. One day, you'll grow old and jaded. Just like your old man. You'll know what this means to me. You'll know why I died for this." She already knew. He already knew she knew. At this point, no words could have meaning. They were in each other's minds. A perfect understanding. What else could you expect from a lifetime together? These days, she was the only one he could open up to. He liked it that way though, and deep down, so did she. Mal opened her mouth, almost involuntarily. What did she even want to say? What was she even able to say? Nothing. There was no turning back at this point. No, they were past that point for a long time now. Mal turned and left. The door closes behind her.
        </p>

        <p>
          Captain sat for a long time, gripping his roll of paper. His mind was made up, had been for years. He knew tonight was the night, but. But what? He was frightful. He often was. From day one, his gut turns at the slightest hint of danger. It kept him alert, alive. But today he no longer needed that. He calmed himself down, unraveled his scroll, and read. For the first time in his life, he refused to hold back his tears. As he read, the passages he finished were blotted away. The last memories he had of her, the only thing tying him to this world. Soon it would be gone forever. Soon. It was all over.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mal hardly slept that night. She put it off as long as she could, but midday came and there was no longer any time to wait. It had to be now. The walk to the Captain's quarters is the longest it's ever been. She raises her fist, stops herself. She opens the door. Empty. Silently, she weeps. Bites her tongue. This can't happen anymore, she thinks. And she hides her tears. And she goes out to her men.
